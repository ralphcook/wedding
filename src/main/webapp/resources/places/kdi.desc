The <B>King's Daughters Inn</B> was originally a home for older unmarried women, 
funded by the Duke family. This building was built by the Daughters for 
this purpose, and opened in 1926.

<P>By coincidence, one of Jennifer's great aunts -- Preston Hall's sister,
the late Olga Dean -- was a King's Daughter.
