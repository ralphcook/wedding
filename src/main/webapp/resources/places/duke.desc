Trinity College changed its name to Duke University at the time of its 
endowment by James Buchanan Duke in 1924. The original campus, now 
called "East Campus", is across the street from The King's Daughters Inn.

<P>The area is very popular for joggers and such; we do recommend caution
if you venture out on foot in the area.
